# vanilla-javascript-projects
A collection of different vanilla JavaScript projects I have made to build command over JS/HTML/CSS etc. Anyone is free to use the projects as templates for furthering your interests. Cheers!

This folder has the folllowing **Projects** implemented in it:

1. **CountDown Timer** - The background image is taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/h6qnnmbkLBU). The target time can be easily changed alongwith the heading, for desired events. 

2. **Notes App** - The app allows for CRUD operations for the purposes of note making. Also, local storage is used to keep the notes in memory for individual users. Notes support markdown input from the user. 

3. **ToDo App** - The app allows user to perform write down/complete (and then strikethrough)/delete operations. User can add a task to the list, strikethrough with the left click to mark the task completed, and delete a completed task with the right click, as desired. Local Storage functionality is provided so data is not lost when page is refreshed.
