# vanilla-javascript-projects
A collection of different vanilla JavaScript projects I have made to build command over JS/HTML/CSS etc. Anyone is free to use the projects as templates for furthering your interests. Cheers!

This folder has the folllowing **Projects** implemented in it:

1. **CountDown Timer** - The background image is taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/h6qnnmbkLBU). The target time can be easily changed alongwith the heading, for desired events. 

2. **Notes App** - The app allows for CRUD operations for the purposes of note making. Also, local storage is used to keep the notes in memory for individual users. Notes support markdown input from the user. 

3. **ToDo App** - The app allows user to perform write down/complete (and then strikethrough)/delete operations. User can add a task to the list, strikethrough with the left click to mark the task completed, and delete a completed task with the right click, as desired. Local Storage functionality is provided so data is not lost when page is refreshed.

4. **Drawing App** - This app allows the user to draw in a border defined space with their desired colors. The user can increase/decrease the font, clear the drawing boord and select any color of their liking. The app takes the rudimentary method of drawing consecutive circles to add on top of it, a smooth and continuous line pattern that that is perceived as a normal line to the naked eye.

5. **GitHub Profile Search App** - The app integrates the GitHub API to enable search for any users on github. The search returns the user profile in an appealing card format wherein the card contains the following: username, user profile image, user bio, number of followers, following and the number of public github repositories from that account. The gradient colors are taken from [Egg Gradient](https://www.eggradients.com/).
